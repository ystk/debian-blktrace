Description: utilities for block layer IO tracing
 blktrace is a block layer IO tracing mechanism which provides detailed
 information about request queue operations up to user space. There are
 three major components that are provided:
 .
 blktrace: A utility which transfers event traces from the kernel
 into either long-term on-disk storage, or provides direct formatted
 output (via blkparse).
 .
 blkparse: A utility which formats events stored in files, or when
 run in live mode directly outputs data collected by blktrace.
 .
 Running blktrace requires a patch to the Linux kernel which includes the
 kernel event logging interfaces, and patches to areas within the block
 layer to emit event traces.  These patches have been included in the main
 Linux kernel since 2.6.17-rc1, and the default Debian kernel since 2.6.23.
