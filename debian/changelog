blktrace (0~git-20061221162513-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * New fix for the store_barier() issue; we are now using our own header with
    just the wmb() macros copied from the kernel source.
    Thanks to p2-mate and pbrook for helping me fix this!
    (closes: #406004, #406821)
  * Fixed bashism in debian/rules

blktrace (0~git-20061221162513-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fixed a typo in the description (Thanks to Lo√Øc for noticing!)
    (closes: #405935)
  * Rather than defining our own store_barrier() for each architecture, just
    use wmb() from <asm/system.h>.  This fixes build problems on lots of
    architectures (I hope).
    (closes: #406004)
  * Added Build-depends on patch
  * Fix applying of pacthes in debian/rules.  This would fail if there was
    more than 1 patch present
